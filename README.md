# Se115_Project
 
This is a project for the Se115
Creating a game called pi≈üti

Note:
This was my first term project so the code is a little bit scuffed.

You can find my [wiki](https://github.com/esezak/Se115_Project/wiki) here
Wiki also doubles as my documentation of my program based on the functional requirements in the SE 115 Project Description.pdf
